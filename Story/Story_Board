Lore: The Red Plague
The Red Plague is a crystalized Virus controlled by the main enemy/villain in the story, The Silver Emperor
The Virus can be spread in mostly 3 ways
Bite, scratch or harm done by an infected to non infected
Consuming the crystal
Having  skin contact and breaking said skin on a crystal, forming small crystal sprouts on the infected
The Virus is indeed quite a terrifying foe, able to wipe out and transform villages into small crystalized nests, or even castles and forts into larger nests
The Red Plague does have it's own small nests called The Red ADen, bigger nests are called The Red Infestation
These nests are formed with crystals and limbs or bodies of living oranisms, creating new types of abominations to add in there ranks, basically a breeding ground of nightmares
Red Dens usually are quite easy to destroy, but Red Infestations does have some sort of queen like creature living within them, making it a terrifying boss to fight
(note ill go over different infection/mutant types and full on crystal abominations later)
Some landmarks of special types of full functional nests are, The Red Heart, Jackson's Riverside, Star Fort, Devil's Consumption and The Red Eye 
(note ill be going over full detail so far i have on nests later) 
The virus takes time depending on where the person have been infected, if consumed a crystal its usually 3-5 minutes, if bit in the torso or arm region it usually takes 5 minutes, if bit on the neck or head it takes 1 minute, if on the leg it takes 7 minutes
The infection rate varies as well on the person and there body/weight, also affecting the creature outcome
Current Lore on the Red Plague, will add more if there is an Update
Common Infected (Corrupted/Sinners)
These common infected do still resemble a humanoid being, but depending on bite spot and other factors there will be red crystals growing out of there skin and body, some infected even have there arms fully replaced by the crystal
There highly aggressive, attracted to loud noises and basically anything living, they do have a pack mentality a bit and sometimes do stray to hunt alone
They are quite dumb . .but some do display some intellect like using a weapon they had before death . .but barely able to use it .. just swing it
They are quite easy to kill, the fastest way is to aim for the head, but you can also kill them like a normal human being, 
But in packs they are indeed a force to be reckon with, they still can sprint and try to overrun there victims
Second Varient of Common Infected (Corrupted/Sinner) Called Sinners
Sinners are common infected but instead have a black tainted crystal instead of red .. these infected aare the same like Corrupted but actually quite stronger, can take a beating to the head and as well display a bit more intellect, using more weapons or items than there hands
Sinner's can take more of a beating . .and can as well be dangerous to take .. fighting a pack of sinner's is extremely difficult . .
they look the same as the Corrupted but just black crystals instead of red
Special Infected (Siege Beast/Abomination) 
These creature's are the basic tanks/giant creature's of the Red Plague
There bodies are fused of living tissue of multiple organisms like humans or animals and as well the crystal
They have two giant hulking arms they use to walk, as there old small legs can't carry there massive weight, the head and body is basically consumedi n crystal, but the mouth has extended and jawline, forming a giant gaping mouth, as the eye;s are mostly covered in crystal
Due to being partially blind, it can be easily mislead by sound which it uses a lot, but it can indeed see decently
The Abomination is a formadible foe and should be taken with the greatest caution
Second Varient of Abomination (The Siege Beast)
Black crystals cover the beast of a creature . .still resembling the abomination . .but quite a few things changed
Deep within the Labs of the White Citadel . . they modified the creature into a siege beast capable of taking down gates and being controlled by a human
These creature's are covered in metal plating, being rode by a Horde Master,  a human from The iron Legion capable of riding one without dying and help control small packs of common infected
Some siege Beasts are outfitted with a small ballista or catapult for taking down walls or causing damage, it;s usually a 50 chance it won't have a weapon or will
On it's front platings they also added large iron claws for ravaging anything . .it's sheer strengh mixed with a sharp edge makes it armor piercing 
The Siege Beast is usually seen in sieges and not really out in the open . .sometimes guarding important locations for the Silver Emperor
Special Infected (Blood Hound/Ravager)
