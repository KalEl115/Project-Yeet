Please put game mechanics here such as health systems or weapon / armor / damage systems. 
This includes but is not limited to the mechanics of health/damage/terrain/enemies/etc
Basic idea of game 
The video gae with be a squad tactical gameplay, controlling a squad up to 4 later 6 survivors during the gae
There wil be a dice system for range weaponery and maybe in future critical for melee, but that might get op
Me and kilo talked and decided in doing in Chapters for the main quest, some story missions must be unlocked through side missions or by doing a unique idea, a research tree
THe research tree wil be used to unlock items and make them out of scrap, wood, iron and so on, allowing players to make certain aror and weaponsalso items for quests
THere will be a home system for the player, a base they can somewhat costumize, if a layer causes to much "tension" aka too many missions in one certain area of the siege map, then that will cause a siege on there base
Due to the siege system it wil allow players to defend there home against invaders, being infected or silver legion, or even state troops due to what side you pick on
Currently in story we havent finished each chapter but we got a main idea, but we do have an idea in the works of how the chapter system wil spit depending on decisons
The game will rely on multiple mission types, as follows Raids on enemy supplies, gatherer missions like materias for crafting or food, kiling an enemy captain/assassinatio missions, Siege battles with allies (Being civilian group, silver legion or states)
the main chapters will have unique mission styles we will make later but again storybord is doing as it can
Enemy units made offcial
Footmen (State/Silver)
6 hitpoints, No armor add on
Weaponery/side being short sword and wooden shield,
Short sword doing 2-3damage (dependig on critical if we do add it in) and as well wooden shield wil be used as a side/tool, like gives a percent chance to block archer fire or close combat (no a big one tho due to them being fodder basically)
There fodder for there lords, the usual men of combat and maybe the first to die, soldiers wanting higher rankings nd status, made up of farmmers or slaves
State version being Keji would have a leather armor style exterior, not given the best indeed and wearing a somewhat coak of an outfit,due to them lving in the more northern area of the states, aloowing them to have cloaks,
there colr patterns are usually white to red/dark red, the dar red being the outline of the clothing and white/red being more inward, forming a pattern
for the Silver Emperor there clothing and armor match the same a bit, but they do wear cloaks due to the siege being in the northern parts of the sta, except there color pattern would be more grey and dull looking, somewhat showing of there useless fodder,
Archer (State/silver)
The archer is picked out hunters and farmers or trained slaves in the art of the bow, not the best or worse, take orers and fire
There fodder like the Footmen, but do have range attacks making them more of a threat with 6 hp as well(edited)
Weaponery being Standard issue bow,  or wooden bow
Doing 2 damage (if we add critical it would be atleast 3-4)
and shortsword, doing 2-3 damage
there loo is near the same as the footmen, but one thing does give them more distinquish being bag of arrows on there back or belt
wearing the coak time outfit s well with the leather armor exterior, the sate having the same color pattern
while the silver has the normal grey dull color agai
